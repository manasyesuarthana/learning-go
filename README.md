 # Learning Go
 Just another repo in my profile that I fill with Go code as I learn how to code using Go. So far Go is pretty Go-ated. 

I may or may not update this in the future, depending on how satisfied I am with my learning. Or maybe I am just lazy sometimes :P

 ## Tech Stack
 It's just Go...

 ## Pre-requisites
 Make sure you have Go Installed in your system. If not, follow the steps specified in this [link](https://go.dev/doc/install) to do so.

 ## Getting Started
 I mean... if you want to use this repo yourself to maybe run or test my code feel free follow the steps below:

 1. Clone the repository
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/manasyesuarthana/learning-go.git
 cd learning-go
 ```

 2. Do whatever you want I guess
 ```bash
cd <learning-section>
#do whatever you want:
go build
go run <filename.go> # or go run .
#... something else
 ```

 That's it! Bye.
